 due to the typedef for socklen_t not being used
-fixed MSDOS line ending issue. (OOPS)
-added GetLibraryVersion to the net namespace to allow version retrieval of
 the linked/shared libaeon library
-slowed version revisioning (yet again) so that completely unstable features

v0.16.19
========
-fixed two instances of functions not returning anything when they should (bools)
-verified MSVC2k5 compilation compatibility and usability

v0.16.18

v0.16.16
=========
-pondered hari kari after dealing with CServerSocket issues
-broke CServerSocket. yay.
-added some documentation, cleaned things up a bit
-expanded CSocket some, to accomodate inheritance better
  *CSocket now contains remote host information
  *CSocket now has it's own .Close() method, for inheritance reasons

v0.16.15
=========
-created documentation for the website as well as the DoxyFile for end-user
 developers
-cleaned up a few things

v0.16.14
=========
-totally diverged from previous versioning convention, it just didn't work.

v0.16.13
=========
-fixed a serious bug where buffer data wasn't cleared prior to recv(), which
 caused data corruption
-moved to an even more convoluted directory structure/autotools setup
-demodularized some files
-created a more "lib-like" installation, which now installs libaeon.h into
 $(PREFIX)/include so you can actually develop with aeon now.
-added the ClearBuffer() function to CSocket so that arbitrary buffers may
 be cleared by the library (usually those passed by Read() calls)

v0.16.12
=========
-fixed a mistake on my part (earmbrust) which had linked in the GPL, rather
 than the proper (BSD) license.
-removed all remnants of the old (script based) build system

v0.16.11
=========
-cleaned up a few simple things
-made the code slightly more modular (separating code into multiple files,

-began ChangeLog documentation (hey, that's an accomplishment!)
